# BotMatrix4 v1


This bot is designed to make your life a little easier when you are trying to build an audience on twitter, once compiled there are a few things you need to do to make it work, you need to enter your credentials into the bot.config.removethispart and the details in the other sections. Then remove the removethispart part. 

Then, run the bot once, it will set itself up.

Then restart it. it could take a long time to get itself properly going, if you already have a massive following. 

#And, importantly:
It did unfollow all of my followers by mistake, and I am not 100% sure it wont do it again, so keep an eye on it. 



#What its for and what it wont do

This bot it designed to give the community a little tickle to help get you noticed, it retweets (provided you set this up properly) hashtags from a specific interest and follows based on a specific interest. 

It doesn not do this by the hundred, and it *should* fall short of twitters limits.

It also unfollows unfollowers after a time of 2 days, but records this so that you don't bother those people again. It is NOT a follow churn bot. 

For best results, use with an already active presence.

That is all
